In this post, I aim to cover several gotcha's,
most of which I hope for your sake you don't encounter regularly;
but for the rare time you do hit one of these stumbling blocks, let's shed a little light on what's going on.


But before we go any further I must confess, saying I hate Javascript is a bit of a lie, I actually love Javascript;
but even I have moments when I stare at my computer screen, head in hands,
cursing the inventors of the language and all those who have contributed to this fine mess of a language we work with all the time;
and since you're interested enough to read this you've probably had those moments too. 


So without further ado, here are those gotcha's:

## Array Holes

## this in arrow functions

## Browser compatability

> can I use and mdn are good resources

## null, undefined and non-existent properties

## Automatic type conversion

# Conclusion

Any more tweet me
